Use at your own risk!\n>\n> Follow https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/discussions/369 for details and updates.\n## Basic Rules\n- `$()` to turn refs into reative variables\n- `$$()` to access the original refs from reative variables\n```js\nimport { ref, watch } from 'vue'\n// bind ref as a variable\nlet count = $(ref(0))\n// no need for .value\nconsole.log(count)\n// get the actual ref\nwatch($$(count), c => console.log(`count changed to ${c}`))\n// assignments are reactive\ncount++\n```\n### Shorthands\nA few commonly used APIs have shorthands (which also removes the need to import them):\n- `$(ref(0))` -> `$ref(0)`\n- `$(computed(() => 123))` -> `$computed(() => 123)`\n- `$(shallowRef({}))` -> `$shallowRef({})`\n## API\nThis package is the lower-level transform that can be used standalone. Higher-level tooling (e.g. `@vitejs/plugin-vue` and `vue-loader`) will provide integration via options.\n### `shouldTransform`\nCan be used to do a cheap check to determine whether full transform should be performed.\n```js\nimport { shouldTransform } from '@vue/ref-transform'\nshouldTransform(`let a = ref(0)`) // false\nshouldTransform(`let a = $ref(0)`) // true\n```\n### `transform`\n```js\nimport { transform } from '@vue/ref-transform'\nconst src = `let a = $ref(0); a++`\nconst {\ncode, // import { ref as _ref } from 'vue'; let a = (ref(0)); a.value++\"\nmap\n} = transform(src, {\nfilename: 'foo.ts',\nsourceMap: true,\n// @babel/parser plugins to enable.\n// 'typescript' and 'jsx' will be auto-inferred from filename if provided,\n// so in most cases explicit parserPlugins are not necessary\nparserPlugins: [/* ... */]\n})\n```\n**Options**\n```ts\ninterface RefTransformOptions {\nfilename?: string\nsourceMap?: boolean // default: false\nparserPlugins?: ParserPlugin[]\nimportHelpersFrom?: string // default: \"vue\"\n}\n```\n### `transformAST`\nTransform with an existing Babel AST + MagicString instance. This is used internally by `@vue/compiler-sfc` to avoid double parse/transform cost.\n```js\nimport { transformAST } from '@vue/ref-transform'\nimport { parse } from '@babel/parser'\nimport MagicString from 'magic-string'\nconst src = `let a = $ref(0); a++`\nconst ast = parse(src, { sourceType: 'module' })\nconst s = new MagicString(src)\nconst {\nrootVars, // ['a']\nimportedHelpers // ['ref']\n} = transformAST(ast, s)\nconsole.log(s.toString()) // let a = _ref(0); a.value++\n```"

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS"
