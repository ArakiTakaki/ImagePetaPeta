    "licenses": "# @vue/ref-transform\n\n> ⚠️ This is experimental and currently only provided for testing and feedback. It may break during patches or even be removed. Use at your own risk!\n>\n> Follow https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/discussions/369 for details and updates.\n\n## Basic Rules\n\n- `$()` to turn refs into reative variables\n- `$$()` to access the original refs from reative variables\n\n```js\nimport { ref, watch } from 'vue'\n\n// bind ref as a variable\nlet count = $(ref(0))\n\n// no need for .value\nconsole.log(count)\n\n// get the actual ref\nwatch($$(count), c => console.log(`count changed to ${c}`))\n\n// assignments are reactive\ncount++\n```\n\n### Shorthands\n\nA few commonly used APIs have shorthands (which also removes the need to import them):\n\n- `$(ref(0))` -> `$ref(0)`\n- `$(computed(() => 123))` -> `$computed(() => 123)`\n- `$(shallowRef({}))` -> `$shallowRef({})`\n\n## API\n\nThis package is the lower-level transform that can be used standalone. Higher-level tooling (e.g. `@vitejs/plugin-vue` and `vue-loader`) will provide integration via options.\n\n### `shouldTransform`\n\nCan be used to do a cheap check to determine whether full transform should be performed.\n\n```js\nimport { shouldTransform } from '@vue/ref-transform'\n\nshouldTransform(`let a = ref(0)`) // false\nshouldTransform(`let a = $ref(0)`) // true\n```\n\n### `transform`\n\n```js\nimport { transform } from '@vue/ref-transform'\n\nconst src = `let a = $ref(0); a++`\nconst {\n  code, // import { ref as _ref } from 'vue'; let a = (ref(0)); a.value++\"\n  map\n} = transform(src, {\n  filename: 'foo.ts',\n  sourceMap: true,\n\n  // @babel/parser plugins to enable.\n  // 'typescript' and 'jsx' will be auto-inferred from filename if provided,\n  // so in most cases explicit parserPlugins are not necessary\n  parserPlugins: [/* ... */]\n})\n```\n\n**Options**\n\n```ts\ninterface RefTransformOptions {\n  filename?: string\n  sourceMap?: boolean // default: false\n  parserPlugins?: ParserPlugin[]\n  importHelpersFrom?: string // default: \"vue\"\n}\n```\n\n### `transformAST`\n\nTransform with an existing Babel AST + MagicString instance. This is used internally by `@vue/compiler-sfc` to avoid double parse/transform cost.\n\n```js\nimport { transformAST } from '@vue/ref-transform'\nimport { parse } from '@babel/parser'\nimport MagicString from 'magic-string'\n\nconst src = `let a = $ref(0); a++`\nconst ast = parse(src, { sourceType: 'module' })\nconst s = new MagicString(src)\n\nconst {\n  rootVars, // ['a']\n  importedHelpers // ['ref']\n} = transformAST(ast, s)\n\nconsole.log(s.toString()) // let a = _ref(0); a.value++\n```\n"

    "name": "binary-search-tree@0.2.5",
    "licenses": "# Binary search trees for Node.js\n\nTwo implementations of binary search tree: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree\" target=\"_blank\">basic</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree\" target=\"_blank\">AVL</a> (a kind of self-balancing binmary search tree). I wrote this module primarily to store indexes for <a href=\"https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb\" target=\"_blank\">NeDB</a> (a javascript dependency-less database).\n\n\n## Installation and tests\nPackage name is `binary-search-tree`.\n\n```bash\nnpm install binary-search-tree --save\n\nmake test\n```\n\n## Usage\nThe API mainly provides 3 functions: `insert`, `search` and `delete`. If you do not create a unique-type binary search tree, you can store multiple pieces of data for the same key. Doing so with a unique-type BST will result in an error being thrown. Data is always returned as an array, and you can delete all data relating to a given key, or just one piece of data.\n\n```javascript\nvar BinarySearchTree = require('binary-search-tree').BinarySearchTree\n  , AVLTree = require('binary-search-tree').AVLTree   // Same API as BinarySearchTree\n\n// Creating a binary search tree\nvar bst = new BinarySearchTree();\n\n// Inserting some data\nbst.insert(15, 'some data for key 15');\nbst.insert(12, 'something else');\nbst.insert(18, 'hello');\n\n// You can insert multiple pieces of data for the same key\n// if your tree doesn't enforce a unique constraint\nbst.insert(18, 'world');\n\n// Retrieving data (always returned as an array of all data stored for this key)\nbst.search(15);   // Equal to ['some data for key 15']\nbst.search(18);   // Equal to ['hello', 'world']\nbst.search(1);    // Equal to []\n\n// Search between bounds with a MongoDB-like query\n// Data is returned in key order\n// Note the difference between $lt (less than) and $gte (less than OR EQUAL)\nbst.betweenBounds({ $lt: 18, $gte: 12});   // Equal to ['something else', 'some data for key 15']\n\n// Deleting all the data relating to a key\nbst.delete(15);   // bst.search(15) will now give []\nbst.delete(18, 'world');   // bst.search(18) will now give ['hello']\n```\n\nThere are three optional parameters you can pass the BST constructor, allowing you to enforce a key-uniqueness constraint, use a custom function to compare keys and use a custom function to check whether values are equal. These parameters are all passed in an object.\n\n### Uniqueness\n\n```javascript\nvar bst = new BinarySearchTree({ unique: true });\nbst.insert(10, 'hello');\nbst.insert(10, 'world');   // Will throw an error\n```\n\n### Custom key comparison\n\n```javascript\n// Custom key comparison function\n// It needs to return a negative number if a is less than b,\n// a positive number if a is greater than b\n// and 0 if they are equal\n// If none is provided, the default one can compare numbers, dates and strings\n// which are the most common usecases\nfunction compareKeys (a, b) {\n  if (a.age < b.age) { return -1; }\n  if (a.age > b.age) { return 1; }\n  \n  return 0;\n}\n\n// Now we can use objects with an 'age' property as keys\nvar bst = new BinarySearchTree({ compareKeys: compareKeys });\nbst.insert({ age: 23 }, 'Mark');\nbst.insert({ age: 47 }, 'Franck');\n```\n\n### Custom value checking\n\n```javascript\n// Custom value equality checking function used when we try to just delete one piece of data\n// Returns true if a and b are considered the same, false otherwise\n// The default function is able to compare numbers and strings\nfunction checkValueEquality (a, b) {\n  return a.length === b.length;\n}\nvar bst = new BinarySearchTree({ checkValueEquality: checkValueEquality });\nbst.insert(10, 'hello');\nbst.insert(10, 'world');\nbst.insert(10, 'howdoyoudo');\n\nbst.delete(10, 'abcde');\nbst.search(10);   // Returns ['howdoyoudo']\n```\n\n\n## License \n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Louis Chatriot &lt;louis.chatriot@gmail.com&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n"

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include\n      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate\n      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright 2014 Mozilla\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License.\n"

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include\n      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate\n      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License.\n"
